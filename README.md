This is my **very first Flutter project**! üéâ A simple yet stylish BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator application built with Flutter. It allows users to input their weight in kilograms and height in feet and inches, then calculates and displays their BMI, along with a category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) and corresponding color feedback.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Clean & Modern UI:** Inspired by Material 3 design with a beautiful gradient background and vibrant accent colors.
* **BMI Calculation:** Accurately calculates BMI based on user input.
* **Dynamic Result Feedback:** Displays the calculated BMI and its category (e.g., "Normal Weight", "Overweight") with a color-coded text.
* **User-Friendly Input:** Utilizes `TextField` widgets with clear labels, icons, and numerical keyboard types for easy data entry.
* **Error Handling:** Provides a clear message if all required fields are not filled.
* **Responsive Design:** Uses `SingleChildScrollView` to ensure the layout remains functional even when the keyboard is active or on smaller screens.
